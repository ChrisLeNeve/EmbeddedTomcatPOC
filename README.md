** README **

This is a sample on how to create an embedded Tomcat in your application. Good for example for unit tests.
Followed this tutorial: http://zetcode.com/web/embeddedtomcat/

Run a "mvn clean install" to install dependencies, then hit http://localhost:8083

Have a look at the Tomcat class documentation for more info: https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/api/org/apache/catalina/startup/Tomcat.html
